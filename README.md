# THEIA LANGUAGE
## PURPOSE
The purpose of Theia is to be a more advanced version of the [Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua) programming language, with concepts such as [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), strong typing, and the use of modules, without removing the simplicity.

## WARNING
The project is still in a very early stage, Theia is subject to change.
